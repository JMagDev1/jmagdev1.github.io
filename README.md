#My Personal Website

This is my personal website, it is still a work in progress however once I complete another project I try to update it as soon as I can. The main purpose of this site is to keep track and share all of the projects I have done or am doing, it keeps things organised and it means I can easily see things I have done along with dates and languages used when applicable. The website also has an about me section where I try to tell you a little bit about myself and what things I like to do. If you take a look at my website I hope you like it.

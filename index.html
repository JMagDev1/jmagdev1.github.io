                <p2 >I am a currently studying 3 A Levels subjects: Maths,Technology and Software Systems Development. I hope to progress onto University where I would like to obtain a Software Engineering degree. In my spare time I have a passion for coding and I like to take on manufacturing projects for example an Iron Man helmet. I also love to challenge my coding ability and to try out some new projects (while also revisiting the ones I have already made). The projects that I have completed vary in skill level needed and language used, for example: Python (JARVIS), HTML and CSS (This website), Javascript (learning) and C# (In school). To see any project mentioned here go to the  <a class="Link" href="#Projects">next section </a>on projects</p2>

                <p2>I have completed almost 20 coding projects at the time of writing this (12/2023), I started coding as a hobby insummer 2021 and it took off from there. I started with C# in school and then taught myself some python for <a class="Link" href="https://jmagdev1.github.io/JARVISWebsite/">JARVIS. </a>This was a massive undertaking, considering the only coding I had done till then was in school. Below you can find more information on my projects and what languages I used, and how I went about making them. </p2>

                    <a class="Link ProjectTwoLink ProjectLink" href="HTML Pages/GoogleHomePage2.html">2nd Google Home Page: This is my second Google Home Page that I have created. The main reason I re-done it was because the old one didn't really achieve the look I was aiming for. This was also my first project that had a "client". Although this client was just my very good friend, I still treated it as if they were a proper client and this was a project made for them. It was invaluable to have this, they gave me cruitial feedback on features and what more to add or not to add. Click on me to learn more!</a>
                    <a class="Link ProjectThreeLink ProjectLink" href="HTML Pages/NatureExplorer.html">Nature Explorer: This was is my first proper 3D game. It was made with unity. I do not own or take credit for the assets used in this game. I imported the assets and made up the medieval village and modern city myself along with the code for the horse and car movement.

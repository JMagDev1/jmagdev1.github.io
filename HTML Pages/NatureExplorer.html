        <p class="text">On the left you can see an overview of the whole terrain in my nature explorer game. In the game there is no main objective, you can just walk around and admire the scenery. I have not made any of the models in the game, however I have created the scripts for the movment of horses and vehicles, as well as the FPS counter at the top left of the screen.</p>

    <div class="SectionTwo">
        <img class="image" src="../Images/Nature Explorer/Pic2.png" alt="Image 2">
        <p class="text">Here is an overview of the city. The video at the bottom shows the vehicles moving. The city contains: Factories, Houses, a Supermarket, a Stadium, Hotels and much more! At the top center of the image you can see the start of a dirt road. This road takes the player to the medieval style village. (More info below) </p>

    <div class="SectionThree">
        <img class="image" src="../Images/Nature Explorer/Pic3.png" alt="Image 3">
        <p class="text">This is a birdseye view of the medieval village. You can see there are 2 main housing blocks along with farm land and a market. In the center of the village there is an animal pen. It contains 10 horses. These horses are programmed to move randomly between coordinates (Waypoints) inside the pen.</p>

        <iframe class="Video" src="../Images/Nature Explorer/Video4.mp4" alt="Video 4"></iframe>
        <p class="text">Here is the video I mentioned above. It shows a taxi in the city moving between a few set coordinates (Waypoints) along the road. At the time of writing I have not quite finished this game, however I plan to soon and will add more traffic while completing it. </p>

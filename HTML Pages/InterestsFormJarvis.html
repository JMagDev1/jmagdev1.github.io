        <p class="text">When I was creating JARVIS I wanted to create a form that took in information based on the name of a person eg where they were from, their height, their favourite food etc. Unfortunatly at the time I did not have the knowledge to make this a reality. I planned to make this form from a C# .NET Form, then it would be able to get the information that the user inputs into system and be able to do different things with the information.</p>

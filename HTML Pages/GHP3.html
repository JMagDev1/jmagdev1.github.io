        <img class="image" src="../Images/GHP3/Image1.png" alt="Image 1">
        <p class="text">On the left is the custom layout of links, here the user can display up to 20 links of their choice.</p>     
    </div>

    <div class="SectionTwo">
        <img class="image" src="../Images/GHP3/Image2Preset1.png" alt="Image 2">
        <p class="text">This image showcases the layout of preset 1, this is the layout I copied over from my 2nd Google Home Page. Using this preset the user cannot add or remove any links in the settings menu. Your preference on layout is saved using localstorage and will re open as that layout when the page is closed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SectionThree">
        <img class="image" src="../Images/GHP3/Image3Settings.png" alt="Image 3">
        <p class="textImg3">The image on the left shows the settings bar along the bottom of the screen. This is used to: Set your name, save links to the button container on the page, Remove links, adjust the blur and brightness of the image, setting the background picture theme and also set the colour theme of the page. The name and links are saved using localstorage and so does the background theme and colour theme.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SectionFour">
        <img class="image" src="../Images/GHP3/Image4SettingsP1.png" alt="Image 4">
        <p class="text">This image shows the settings bar for those who choose the preset for links on the Google Home Page. As you can see you can't add or remove any buttons with this preset because it is a set layout and buttons. This can be beneficial for the user because they don't need to spend time adding custom links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SectionFour">
        <p class="textFooter">I spent over 10 hours in total working on this project. I recorded around 6 hours and put it into a timelapse, <a href="https://youtu.be/GEEhVsY4d4A">this</a> is a link to the video of my recording.</p>
